# Backend API URL
# The video call microservice is available at VITE_BACKEND_URL/video-call
# In nginx, the /video-call path is removed and proxied to the microservice
# but in the frontend, you must include /video-call in the connection
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Example for production:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourapp.com
